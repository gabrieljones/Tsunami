# Tsunami Mk 2

Send a wave, capture the shore. A game for Blinks. https://blinks.games/

Players: Up to 5 teams

Teams: Each team can have as many players as will fit around the table.

Blinks: 24 - infinity  

Playtime: short, to be determined

Try to claim the shore with waves of your team's color.

## Setup

Each player chooses a team color: Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, or Megenta.

Place the blinks in one large cluster.  "Holes" made by removing one or two blinks can be used to maximize the ocean size of a given quantity of blinks.

## Play

When an Ocean tile becomes a Wave Trigger of your team's color, click it to send a wave of your color.

## Victory

When there are no more Ocean tiles, count up the Claimed Shore tiles of each color. The team color with the most Claimed tiles wins.

## Reset

Long press any blink to send a reset wave that reinitializes all blinks to ocean tiles.


## Tiles

### Ocean

Blinks start as ocean tiles, which propogate waves.

Randomly become Wave Triggers.

### Wave Triggers

Allow triggering a wave of the indicated team color

Single click -> Send Wave of the indicated color

### Shore Open

Blinks on the edge will show a white border indicating they are open shore tiles available to be claimed by the next wave to crash into them.

When a wave crashes into an open shore, the blink becomes "Shore Claimed" for the team color of the crashing wave.

### Shore Claimed

Locked to the team color of the wave that crashed into it.

## Known Issues

- Only 5 colors enabled
- Colors 6 and 7 end up causing weird propagation effects.
- Animations need lots of work.
- Waves of the same color will cancel eachother out.
- Large holes in the ocean (3-4+ tiles) will create continuous wave generators.
